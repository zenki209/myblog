# Ten Common Questions from Kendo RANT
*October 16, 2025*

> **Less “tricks”, more truth:** build fundamentals, presence, and character.

Over the last year, our Kendo RANT episodes have answered hundreds of viewer questions.  
These ten summarised questions stand out for the same reason: the solution is rarely a shortcut.  
It’s about correct basics, calm intent, and steady character.  

Here’s a refined, link-free write-up you can apply in your next keiko.

## 1. How can I make my footwork faster without losing balance?

Footwork (*ashi-sabaki*) drives every technique. Speed comes from **efficient mechanics**, not frantic legs.  
Build quiet *suri-ashi*, crisp *okuri-ashi*, and compact movements. Keep posture tall, hips forward, toes pointing ahead, and the left heel lightly off the ground.

**Training tips:**

- **Drill daily:** 3–5 minutes each of *zenshin/kōtai* (forward/back) *suri-ashi*, focusing on smooth, silent glide.  
- **Push, don’t bounce:** Drive from the rear leg; avoid “jumping” steps that waste energy.  
- **Burst distance:** Shorter steps from *issoku-itto* accelerate faster than overly long reaches.  
- **Off-floor work:** Skipping rope, light ladder drills, and measured *suburi* can support quick feet.

## 2. I’m aiming for a higher dan — what do examiners look for?

Beyond clean cuts, examiners look for **presence**: controlling centreline, creating chances, striking at the right moment, and showing clear *zanshin*.  
Rushing multiple attacks reads as impatience. Watching your opponent closely, and selecting techniques appropriately, is the key to success.

**Key reminders:**

- **Basics win:** Decisive *men*, *kote*, *dō* with spirit and finish beat messy or flashy techniques.  
- **Project intent:** Breathe, settle the gaze, and let posture carry confidence from *sonkyō* onward.  
- **Make pressure:** Practise with full concentration during *jigeiko* to learn how to create and seize opportunity.

## 3. Nerves ruin my *shiai* — how do I control them?

Treat matches as an **extension of everyday keiko**. Use breathing to channel energy and focus on the next action, not the result.

**Tips for calmness:**

- **Pre-match routine:** Light *suburi*, deep breaths, stay hydrated.  
- **In the shiai-jo:** Keep shoulders and arms relaxed; don’t get carried away.  
- **Reframe nerves:** Nervousness is normal — it can fuel focus. Do your best, and accept results gracefully.

## 4. Should I cross-train outside the dojo?

Kendo comes first; **smart cross-training supports it.** Think cardio for endurance, mobility for longevity, and light strength for structure.

- **Cardio:** Steady runs or intervals 1–2×/week.  
- **Strength:** Bodyweight + light weights (legs, core, shoulders). No need to bulk.  
- **Agility:** Ladder patterns and balance drills improve footwork quality.  
- **Recovery:** Stretch hips/ankles; sleep well; avoid overtraining; drink lots of water.

## 5. My *fumikomi* feels slow — especially as I get older. Fixes?

*Fumikomi-ashi* is a **coordinated push-pull**: the left foot drives the body forward, the right foot stamps as a by-product.  
Don’t chase loud sounds; they slow you down and collapse posture.

- **Knees forward:** Avoid twisting the left foot; keep knees tracking straight.  
- **Right distance:** Launch from *issoku-itto*, not too far out.  
- **Correct landing:** A crisp sound is fine, but **timing and posture** matter more.  

---

## 6. Should I rely on strength or technique?

Technique and timing.  
Whether *shikake-waza* (initiating) or *oji-waza* (countering), you win by **managing centreline, distance, and opportunity** — not by brute force.

- **Economy:** Clean paths, minimal tension, correct cutting line.  
- **Hips & core:** Drive from the centre; arms guide, they don’t heave.  
- **Complete actions:** In *renzoku-waza*, every strike is real — no lazy follow-ups.

## 7. What is *zanshin* and how do I show it in grading?

*Zanshin* is **continued readiness after the strike.**  
Pass your opponent decisively, maintain eye contact, turn with balance, and stay prepared to continue.  
Dropping your guard or relaxing early reads as inattention.  

---

## 8. What about *hiki-tsuki*? Should I use it?

*Hiki-waza* (backward techniques) from *tsuba-zeriai* favour *men*, *kote*, or *dō*.  
Backward *tsuki* is unsafe and unclear — **avoid it**.  

For proper *hiki-waza*:

- Create an opening with *seme*.  
- Step back with *fumikomi* and strike.  
- Retreat quickly, showing clear *zanshin*.

## 9. How should I relate to teachers and seniors? (…and avoid dojo drama)

Respect first, always.  
Bow when entering or leaving, greet with *aisatsu*, line up when called, and listen without interrupting. Offer help when asked; avoid unsolicited corrections.

- **Address properly:** Use “Sensei” toward teachers.  
- **Resolve quietly:** If conflict arises, speak privately and respectfully — no gossip.  
- **Community mindset:** Your attitude shapes dojo culture as much as your technique.

## 10. Does kendo help with mental health?

Many practitioners experience kendo as **active meditation** — strong *kiai*, rhythmic movement, and focused breath bring you into the present.  
Regular training can reduce stress, improve focus, and build resilience. It complements, not replaces, professional care when needed.

> *Note:* If you’re struggling, seek appropriate support.  
> Bring kendo along as a positive routine.

## Final Thoughts

Across all ten questions, one message stands out:  
**Quality over speed, presence over force, respect over ego.**  

Keep polishing the basics, carry yourself with intent,  
and let every bow, step, and strike shape your **character as well as your kendo**.
