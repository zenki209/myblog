### Download the Process Explorer

The process explorer tool can be download from the [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).

### Installing the process explorer
1. Download the Process Explorer zip file from the Microsoft website.   
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open the folder where you extracted the files and double-click on `procexp.exe` to run the Process Explorer.
4. If prompted, allow the application to run with administrative privileges.

### Using the Process Explorer  
1. **View Running Processes**: The main window displays a list of all running processes on your system. You can see details like process name, PID (Process ID), CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
