One article I found useful today inspired these notes.

In recent years I have noticed that many high‑school and university students tend to rely on one‑sided tactics: attack Men to draw attention then strike Kote, or feint Omote and finish with Men from Ura. These approaches can work briefly because they reduce obvious exposure, but they depend heavily on speed and power. Since those attributes are limited, progress requires learning to sense the opponent’s condition and seize naturally arising openings.

At the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Kanoya many students go on to become Kendo instructors. As a teacher I aim to equip students with techniques and judgment that last a lifetime, not only tricks that defeat weaker opponents.

Kendo has a saying: “the place where you can strike is also the place where you can be struck.” A genuinely recognized ippon comes when you commit to a technique while accepting the risk. Debana‑waza best expresses this idea: it asks you to sense the opponent’s intent, provoke or anticipate movement, and strike at the decisive instant. This is a difficult skill that requires timing, awareness, and nerve.

I think of this as operating in the narrow space between offense and defense. When you capture that fleeting moment where striking and being struck nearly coincide and hold your technique with resolve, you can achieve a decisive ippon. This is especially important in Dan examinations, where opponents are closely matched and the margin for error is small: you must maintain technique until the last moment and accept the risk that comes with it.

Practice tips:
- Train sensing and timing (debana and reaction drills), not just isolated strikes.  
- Practice controlled risk‑taking: attempt exposed techniques then review outcomes.  
- Use randori and jigeiko with specific goals: look for openings rather than forcing attacks.
